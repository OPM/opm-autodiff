/*
    Here keywords are defined that are supported by flow, but have items that
    are only partially supported.

    The keywords are specified in a mapping with the keyword names as keys, and
    values that describe the set of supported items. These are described by a
    mapping from the item name to a struct of properties, defined in KeywordValidation.hpp.

    This struct has the following fields:

    critical (bool) : if this is a critical error.
    permitted_values (vector of strings) : the list of values that is allowed.
    message (itemal string): an optional message to add to the error reported by flow.

    Below is the set of partiall supported keywords, currently used by flow.
