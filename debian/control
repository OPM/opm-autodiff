Description: Parallel porous media / reservoir simulators -- development files
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery.
 .
 opm-simulators provides a research (ebos) and a production (flow) fully
 implicit black-oil simulators, supporting one to three phases and
 supporting solvent and polymer options. It uses cell centered finite
 volume schemes with two point flux approximation and automatic
 differentiation for the discretization and uses state of the art linear
 and nonlinear solvers. It supports standard and multi segment well
 models and reading and writing file in Eclipse format, a very common
 format used in the oil reservoir simulation community.
 .
 Package provides the development files (headers and shared library links).
